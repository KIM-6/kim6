# Images Service menu for Dolphin (Plasma 6)

This is a basic port of KIM5 for Plasma 6. KIM itself apparently goes as far back as KDE3, at least.

Note that some actions in the treatment and publication menu do not work. Patches to either make them work or remove them altogether are welcome.

Here is the KDE store link: https://store.kde.org/p/2307290/
